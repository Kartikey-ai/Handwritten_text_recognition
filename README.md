# Handwritten_text_recognition

Objective was to predict the handwritten text in the images provided by the dataset. 
Various deep learning and machine learning algorithm and new researches are done in this field.

What I have used in this implementation is CNN + Bi LSTM + CTC.
Convolution neural network was used to extract a feature map from the images. Then this feature map 
was fed into LSTM and then using CTC function actual text was predicted.
